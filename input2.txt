wildlife, in the past, has coexisted with other forms of life, such as humans, plants, etc. in its natural habitat in the wild. But with increasing population and various human activities, such as developmental works, hunting, poaching, etc. there has been significant reduction in the number of species as well as their population. So there is a need to protect different types of wildlife in their natural habitat. Some of the measures that have been undertaken include establishment of reserve forests, national parks, wild life sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves.
